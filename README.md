## Why Claude SMS?

When Claude Code needs your input--a question, approval, or notification--you shouldn't have to be tethered to your terminal.

| Scenario | Without Claude SMS | With Claude SMS |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Task completes | Sit and wait, or miss it | Get email: "Task completed!" |
| Claude asks a question | Session blocks until you notice | Get email, reply from anywhere |
| Destructive operation | Must be at terminal to approve | Approve via email: "Y" |
| Long-running task | Keep checking back | Do other things, get notified |

**The result:** Run background tasks with confidence. Walk away. Your inbox keeps you connected.

---

## Features

- **Email Notifications** -- Get alerts when tasks complete or errors occur
- **Interactive Prompts** -- Respond to Claude's questions via email reply
- **Approval Requests** -- Approve or deny destructive operations remotely
- **Multi-Session** -- Track multiple Claude Code sessions independently
- **Easy Toggle** -- Enable/disable with `/sms on` or `/sms off`
- **Cross-Platform** -- Works on any OS with Node.js
- **Provider Flexible** -- Gmail by default, configurable SMTP/IMAP

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**
- **Email account with SMTP/IMAP access** (Gmail recommended)
- **App password** (for Gmail: 16-character app-specific password)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Email Account for Claude

Set up a dedicated email account for Claude notifications (e.g., `claude-notify@gmail.com`).

For Gmail:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on the account
2. Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Create a new app password (select "Mail" and your device)
4. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)

### 2. Install the Plugin

```bash
claude /plugin add github.com/chris-bluera/claude-sms
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
export EMAIL_USER=claude-notify@gmail.com   # Claude's email account
export EMAIL_PASS=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx       # App password (no spaces)
export EMAIL_RECIPIENT=you@example.com      # Your email to receive notifications
```

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence.

### 4. Start the Bridge Server

```bash
npx claude-sms server
```

### 5. Test the Setup

```bash
npx claude-sms test
```

Or in Claude Code:
```
/sms-test
```

## How It Works

```
+-----------------+    Hook     +-----------------+   Email    +----------+
|  Claude Code    |--triggered->|  Bridge Server  |----------->|  Inbox   |
|                 |             |   (SMTP/IMAP)   |            |          |
|                 |<--response--|                 |<---reply---|          |
+-----------------+             +-----------------+            +----------+
```

1. Claude Code triggers a hook (notification, tool use, etc.)
2. Hook sends message to bridge server
3. Bridge server sends email via SMTP
4. User replies to the email
5. Bridge server reads reply via IMAP polling
6. Reply is deleted from inbox after processing
7. Hook retrieves response and returns it to Claude Code

---

## Email Format

### Outbound

Subject line includes session ID for threading:
```
[CC-abc123] Approve tool use?
```

Body:
```
Tool: Bash - Approve? (Y/N)

Reply to this email with your response.
```

### Inbound

Simply reply to the email. The session ID is extracted from the subject line automatically.

---

## Hook Events

| Event | Trigger | Email Sent |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `Notification` | Status updates, completions | Yes (by default) |
| `Stop` | Session ends | Yes (by default) |
| `PreToolUse` | Before Bash/Write/Edit | Yes (awaits approval) |

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EMAIL_USER` | Yes | - | Email address for Claude (sending account) |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | Yes | - | Email app password |
| `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` | Yes | - | Your email to receive notifications |
| `SMTP_HOST` | No | smtp.gmail.com | SMTP server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | No | 587 | SMTP server port |
| `IMAP_HOST` | No | imap.gmail.com | IMAP server hostname |
| `IMAP_PORT` | No | 993 | IMAP server port |
| `EMAIL_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | No | 5000 | How often to check for replies (ms) |
| `BRIDGE_PORT` | No | 3847 | Bridge server port |
| `BRIDGE_URL` | No | http://localhost:3847 | Bridge server URL |

### Non-Gmail Providers

For other email providers, configure the SMTP/IMAP settings:

**Outlook/Office 365:**
```bash
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.office365.com
export SMTP_PORT=587
export IMAP_HOST=outlook.office365.com
export IMAP_PORT=993
```

**Yahoo:**
```bash
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
export SMTP_PORT=465
export IMAP_HOST=imap.mail.yahoo.com
export IMAP_PORT=993
```

### State File

Settings are stored in `~/.claude/claude-sms/state.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": true,
    "Stop": true,
    "PreToolUse": true,
    "UserPromptSubmit": false
  }
}
```

## Security

- **App Passwords** -- Never use your main email password; use app-specific passwords
- **Dedicated Account** -- Use a separate email account for Claude notifications
- **Email Verification** -- Only responds to emails from your configured recipient
- **Session IDs** -- Prevent cross-session interference
- **Timeout** -- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **No Secrets** -- Never sends credentials/secrets via email

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Email Not Sending</b></summary>

1. Verify environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   echo $EMAIL_USER
   echo $EMAIL_PASS
   echo $EMAIL_RECIPIENT
   ```
2. Check that you're using an app password, not your main password
3. For Gmail, ensure 2FA is enabled and app password is correct
4. Check server logs for SMTP errors
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Response Not Received</b></summary>

1. Check server logs for IMAP polling errors
2. Verify the reply was sent from the correct email address (EMAIL_RECIPIENT)
3. Make sure the subject line contains the session ID `[CC-xxxxx]`
4. Check spam folder for the original notification
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Server Not Starting</b></summary>

1. Check if port 3847 is in use: `lsof -i :3847`
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Try a different port: `npx claude-sms server -p 3848`
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gmail "Less Secure Apps" Error</b></summary>

Gmail no longer supports "less secure apps." You must:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Create an app-specific password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the 16-character app password (without spaces)
</details>
